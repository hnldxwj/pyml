1.
import the file:
  from ML import kNN

2.
prepare the trainning file,testing file
  format:
  label val1 val2 val3....
  such as 1 231 2141 123
  1 means the label (or the type)
  231,2141,123 are the key value

3.
  static method: kNN.calc(trainfile,testfile,outputfile,k)
trainfile == trainning file name, such as "train.txt"
testfile  == testing file name, such as "test.txt"
outputfile == result file location,such as "result.txt"
k ==kNN 's param, define the scope
